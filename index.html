<h2>How to get started with Brackets</h2>
    <p>Brackets is an open source, free to use code editor for beginner and professional website developers. <br>
    The most common coding type used on Brackets is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). 
<h4>Here are some steps to help you on your Brackets journey!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> First, you need to learn how to code using HTML, the most basic of coding languages. You can learn HTML using tutorial sites like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy.</li> </a> <br>

        <br>
    <li>After learning the basics, you'll need a place to type your code. Of course, I recommend brackets. <br>

        <br>
    <li> As soon as you download brackets, you'll need to create your own page. You can do this by pressing the file button in the top right, and opening your new project in a folder with a name of your choice. Also, make a seperate image and CSS file folder for later.</li> <br></b>
