<h2>How to get started with Brackets</h2>
    <p>Brackets is an open source, free to use code editor for beginner and professional website developers. <br>
    The most common coding type used on Brackets is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). 
<h4>Here are some steps to help you on your Brackets journey!</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> First, you need to learn how to code using HTML, the most basic of coding languages. <br> You can learn HTML using tutorial sites like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css">Khan Academy.</li> </a> <br>

        <br>
    <li>After learning the basics, you'll need a place to type your code. Of course, I recommend brackets. <br>

        <br>
    <li> As soon as you download brackets, you'll need to create your own page. <br> You can do this by pressing the file button in the top right, and opening your new <br> project in a folder with a name of your choice. Also, put an image and CSS folder inside of that folder.</li> <br></b>

<h2>How to use Adobe Media Encoder</h2>
<p>  <br>
    AME is a program used for changing and uploading videos. Below is the video I recorded and edited using AME. <br> Drag and drop your video file into the top right, then right click it and press 'exort video settings.' <br>
</p>
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
<source src="Images/WebsiteVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <br>
    
        </video> <br> <br>
<h2> Below are the settings I used... <br> </h2>

<h2> Video and audio settings are the most important, so you can keep all of the other settings the same. </strong> </h2>

<h2>Last but not least, here are my video settings <strong> before</strong></h2>
<img src="Images/Pre-video.png"> <br>
<h2> And after!</h2>

<h2>The file size changed a lot after being encoded, which allowed me to put it on my website. </h2> <br> <i> Overall, I highly recommend created a website as it is very fun. <br> There are many steps, but devoting your time into it definetely pays off! <i> <br> <br> <br>
